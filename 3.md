# Git Ops Introduction
RHACM also having GitOps capabilities for deploying and managing Kubernetes services. The term GitOps is applied to applications or tools that are used to the deploy YAML files that are stored within a git repository. This repository can be private repository on GitHub or GitLab, on premise, or within a public git repository.  GitOps tools can be triggered to deploy or update Kubernetes objects either manually, through a webhook, or automatically. Some GitOps tools even offer the ability to prune or remove resources automatically that are not currently defined wtihin the git repository.

* Configuration is “pulled” into an environment similiar to running a `git pull` on your system
* Some tools require a component to be installed on all clusters. These tools will pull the objects into the cluster.
* Some tools do not require any remote resources to be running. Permissions are created on the remote clusters and configuration is pushed to the cluster.
* Templating available with [Helm](https://helm.sh/) or [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/)
* Quite simply “kubectl apply -f $path” runs over and over
* No Kubernetes object type creation limitations
